### Frontend
- **React 18+**: Modern functional components with hooks
- **CSS3**: Custom styling with responsive design
- **Axios**: HTTP client for API communication
- **html2pdf.js**: PDF generation library for bill export
- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern syntax and features

### Backend
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment
- **Express.js**: Web framework
- **JSON**: Data storage for client information with tax percentages
- **CORS**: Cross-origin resource sharing

##  Architecture Overview

### Backend Responsibilities
The Node.js/Express backend serves as the data layer and API provider:

- **Data Management**: Stores and serves client information from `clients.json`
- **API Endpoints**: Provides RESTful API at `/api/clients` to fetch client data
- **Static Data Serving**: Delivers client names, MWH/KWH flags, and minimum charges
- **CORS Configuration**: Enables cross-origin requests from the React frontend
- **Server Management**: Runs on port 5000 and handles HTTP requests
- **JSON Processing**: Reads and parses client configuration data
- **Error Handling**: Manages server-side errors and API responses

### Frontend Responsibilities
The React frontend handles all user interactions and business logic:

- **User Interface**: Renders the electricity bill calculator dashboard
- **Input Management**: Handles user inputs (present/previous readings, main meter, tax amount)
- **Real-time Calculations**: Performs all mathematical computations client-side
- **Tax Distribution**: Automatically calculates individual tax amounts based on percentages
- **State Management**: Maintains application state using React hooks
- **API Communication**: Fetches client data from backend via Axios
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Updates UI automatically based on user input
- **Formatting Logic**: Handles currency formatting and number display
- **Color Coding**: Applies conditional styling based on client names
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures proper display across different screen sizes
- **Calendar Management**: Month/year selection with dropdown interface
- **PDF Generation**: Creates professional PDF bills with landscape A3 format
- **PDF Optimization**: Hides interactive elements during PDF export

### Data Flow
1. **Backend**: Serves client configuration data (names, types, minimum charges, tax percentages)
2. **Frontend**: Fetches client data on application load
3. **Frontend**: Handles all user inputs and calculations
4. **Frontend**: Distributes tax amounts automatically based on percentages
5. **Frontend**: Displays results in real-time without backend interaction
6. **PDF Export**: Generates professional bills with selected month/year
